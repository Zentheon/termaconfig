name: Publish

# This workflow has two jobs:
# pypi-publish:
#   Sets up a python build env with poetry, runs tests and publishes to PyPI.
#   Also uploads built artifacts for other jobs.
# github-publish:
#   Fetches build-artifact and checks out CHANGELOG.md. Retrieves the changelog 
#   relating to the pushed tag and creates a new release with those inputs.
